# Tribute to Apple's Product(RED)

Hello! This repository is my homage to Apple's noteworthy Product(RED) initiative. As a proud owner of an iPhone 14 from the Product(RED) collection, I felt inspired to create and showcase my unique design elements, adding a personal touch to this special edition iPhone.

## üçé Why Product(RED) Resonates with Me

The Product(RED) collection represents more than just striking aesthetics. It symbolizes a humanitarian mission that "Apple" has undertaken to support the fight against global health challenges like AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. With every purchase from this collection, there's a direct contribution to the Global Fund, a nod to the impactful role businesses can play in global well-being.
